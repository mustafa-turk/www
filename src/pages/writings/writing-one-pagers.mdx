## What are one pagers in software engineering

One pagers in software engineering are short documents that provide a high-level overview of a specific feature or project.

&nbsp;

They are used to communicate the key details of the feature or project to stakeholders, such as project managers, business analysts, and other engineers.

## What to include in one pagers

- Feature goal: a brief statement that describes the purpose of the feature and the problem it aims to solve.
- Scope: a description of the feature's boundaries, including what is and is not included in the scope of the feature.
- Design: a high-level description of the proposed solution, including any key architectural decisions and diagrams that help explain the design.
- Implementation plan: a summary of the steps that will be taken to implement the feature, including any dependencies or constraints that must be taken into account.
- Stakeholders: a list of the people or teams who will be impacted by the feature and their roles in the development process.
- Timeline: an estimation of the feature development time.
